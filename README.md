# ES6 Example Functions

Just a quick example of ES6 functionalities, includes:

 - Template Strings, (i.e: `${weight} lbs`)
 - forEach()
 - .filter()
 - .map()
 - .sort()
 - .reduce()
 
 # Usage Notes
 
 Uncomment code blocks to run, each functional code block follows it's ES standard (ES5/6). I would personally only use these for production in a Node backend or in the .ts files of an application which will transpile to ES5, otherwise you will have IE11 issues.
